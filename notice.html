  <p>Dear Employee,</p>
  <p>We regret to inform you that you have clicked on a phishing link during our recent cybersecurity and phishing compliance test. Your action has been logged and will be used to improve our security measures and employee training.</p>
  <p>We take the security of our company and our employees very seriously, and this incident highlights the importance of remaining vigilant and cautious when dealing with unsolicited emails and links. Please note that the link you clicked on was part of a test and not a real phishing attempt.</p>
  <p>In order to combat phishing attempts in the future, we recommend that you take the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Verify the sender's email address and the content of the email before clicking on any links.</li>
    <li>Hover over the link to check the URL before clicking on it.</li>
    <li>Never share personal or sensitive information via email, even if the request seems legitimate.</li>
    <li>Report suspicious emails or links to the IT department immediately.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We understand that mistakes can happen, and we hope that this experience will help you to be more aware and cautious in the future. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
